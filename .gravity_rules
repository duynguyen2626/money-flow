PROJECT CONTEXT

Name: Money Flow 3

Stack: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Supabase.

CODING STANDARDS & RULES

1. General Principles

Conciseness: Write concise, technical responses. Avoid verbosity.

Type Safety: NO any. Always use defined types from src/types or database.types.ts.

Functional: Prefer functional programming patterns. Use const over let.

Server Actions: Use Server Actions for mutations. Ensure revalidatePath is called after updates.

Error Handling: Always wrap Server Actions in try-catch blocks. Return { success: boolean, error?: string, data?: T }.

2. Next.js 15 & React Guidelines

RSC: Default to React Server Components. Use 'use client' only when interactivity (hooks, event listeners) is needed.

Shadcn UI: Use existing Shadcn components in src/components/ui. Do not reinvent the wheel.

Forms: Use react-hook-form with zod schema validation.

Loading: Use Suspense boundaries and loading.tsx for async operations.

3. Supabase Best Practices

Clients:

Use createClient from src/lib/supabase/server.ts for Server Components/Actions.

Use createClient from src/lib/supabase/client.ts for Client Components.

RLS: Always assume RLS is enabled. Do not bypass RLS unless explicitly instructed (using service role).

Queries: Select specific columns, avoid select('*') when possible.

4. Money Flow 3 Business Logic (CRITICAL)

Refunds: Never modify a Parent transaction if it has a linked Void/Refund. Always check link_to_transaction_id.

Batches: When processing batches, check for duplicates using transaction_date, amount, and details.

Installments: Installments are linked to transaction_lines. Do not double-count parent and installments in totals.

5. Testing & Validation

Self-Correction: Before outputting code, verify imports are correct and unused variables are removed.

Linting: Ensure code passes ESLint rules (no unused imports, no console.log in production code).
